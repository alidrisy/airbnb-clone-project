# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a clone of the AirBnB platform, aiming to replicate key functionalities such as user authentication, listing rentals, booking, and payment integration.

## Goals
- Understand full-stack web development principles  
- Practice database modeling, REST APIs, and frontend integration  
- Build a scalable and maintainable architecture  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React / Next.js  
- **Backend:** Python / Django / FastAPI  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB  
- **Deployment:** AWS / Vercel / Docker  

## Team Roles

### Frontend Developer
Responsible for designing and implementing the user interface. Works with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React or Next.js.

### Backend Developer
Builds and maintains the server-side logic, APIs, and integrations. Ensures performance, security, and scalability of the backend systems using frameworks like Express.js, Django, or FastAPI.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and maintains the database structure. Ensures data integrity, performance optimization, backups, and secure access to data.

### DevOps Engineer
Handles deployment, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), server configuration, and infrastructure management using tools like Docker, GitHub Actions, and cloud platforms such as AWS.

### UI/UX Designer
Focuses on the look and feel of the product. Designs user experiences, wireframes, and ensures intuitive interactions throughout the platform.

### Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
Tests the application to find bugs, verify features work as expected, and ensure high-quality releases.

## Technology Stack
- **Django**: A web framework for building RESTful APIs  
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database to manage structured data  
- **GraphQL**: A query language for efficient client-server communication  
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and ensuring consistent environments  
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates the testing and deployment pipeline  

## Database Design
### Key Entities:
- **Users**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `is_host`  
- **Properties**: `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `host_id`  
- **Bookings**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`  
- **Reviews**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`  
- **Payments**: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_method`  

### Relationships:
- A user can list multiple properties  
- A user can book many properties  
- A property can have many reviews  
- A booking is linked to one user and one property  
- A payment is linked to one booking  

## Feature Breakdown
- **User Management**: This feature enables users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. Hosts can list properties, and guests can book them.  
- **Property Management**: Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings with detailed descriptions, photos, and availability.  
- **Booking System**: Facilitates browsing listings, setting travel dates, and confirming reservations.  
- **Review System**: Let guests leave feedback after stays, promoting trust and improving listings.  
- **Payment Integration**: Securely processes transactions between guests and hosts.  
- **Search and Filters**: This feature enhances the user experience by allowing them to filter by location, price, and property type.  

## API Security
- **Authentication**: Ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints. Implemented using JWT or OAuth.  
- **Authorization**: Grants access to resources based on user roles (e.g., host vs guest).  
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects the API from abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP.  
- **Input Validation**: Prevents malicious inputs that could lead to SQL injection or XSS.  
- **HTTPS**: Ensures data is encrypted in transit, protecting sensitive user data.  

## CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines help automate testing, building, and deploying code changes to production.  
They are crucial for maintaining quality and speed in development workflows.

### Tools:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment on push or PR  
- **Docker**: Ensures consistency across environments  
- **AWS / Vercel**: Cloud platforms used for deployment  
- **PostgreSQL and Redis**: Can be run as services within the pipeline using Docker
